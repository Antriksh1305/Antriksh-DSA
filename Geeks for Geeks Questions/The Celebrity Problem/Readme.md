## The Celebrity Problem (important)

<h3><img width="100" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100402656/215281956-745bfdd6-2534-44d3-8d9d-02f12cd7dbcc.png"></h3>

<h5>Time Complexity: <b>O(N)</b> <br>Space Complexity: <b>O(N)</b></h5>

A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. If you go to a party of N people, find if there is a celebrity in the party or not.
A square NxN matrix M[][] is used to represent people at the party such that if an element of row i and column j  is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. Here M[i][i] will always be 0.
<br><b>Note:</b> Follow 0 based indexing.

#### Example 1:
```
Input:
N = 3
M[][] = {{0 1 0},
         {0 0 0}, 
         {0 1 0}}
Output: 1
Explanation: 0th and 2nd person both
know 1. Therefore, 1 is the celebrity. 
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input:
N = 2
M[][] = {{0 1},
         {1 0}}
Output: -1
Explanation: The two people at the party both
know each other. None of them is a celebrity.
```

#### Your task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function celebrity() which takes the matrix M and its size N as input parameters and returns the index of the celebrity. If no such celebrity is present, return -1.


### Constraints:
- 2 <= N <= 3000
- 0 <= M[][] <= 1
