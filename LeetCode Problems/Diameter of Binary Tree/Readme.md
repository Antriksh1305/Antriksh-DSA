## Diameter of Binary Tree

<h5>Time Complexity: <b>O(N)</b> <br>Space Complexity: <b>O(N)</b></h5>

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

#### Example 1:
<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/06/diamtree.jpg" alt="Example 1">

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
```

### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
