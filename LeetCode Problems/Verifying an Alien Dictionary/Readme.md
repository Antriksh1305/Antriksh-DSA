## Verifying an Alien Dictionary

<h5>Time Complexity: <b>O(N*k)</b> <br>Space Complexity: <b>O(1)</b> <br>where N is number of words and k is the maximum length of a word</h5>

In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) 
According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", 
because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character
```

### Constraints:
- 1 <= words.length <= 100
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 20
- order.length == 26
- All characters in words[i] and order are English lowercase letters.
